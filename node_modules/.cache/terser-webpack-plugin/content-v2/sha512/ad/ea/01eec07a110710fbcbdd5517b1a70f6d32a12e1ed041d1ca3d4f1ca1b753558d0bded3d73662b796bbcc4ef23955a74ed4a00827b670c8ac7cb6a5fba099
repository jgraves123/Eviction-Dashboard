The prevalence of this type of eviction is indicative of our state\\u2019s housing affordability crisis. If a tenant is 15 days late on their rent, their landlord can send a written notice requesting that the tenant pay the owed amount.If the tenant does not pay within 5 days of receiving the notice, the landlord can legally end the rental agreement and file an eviction case against the tenant in the District Court. (<a href='http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170713/how-eviction-works' target='_blank'>Providence Journal</a>)\",\"<u>Lease violations</u>: Tenants can be evicted after repeated noncompliance with the terms of the lease. This can include things like noise complaints and failure to maintain the property.If a tenant receives this type of eviction notice, they will be given 20 days to either fix the lease violation or vacate their apartment.\",\"<u>Self-help</u>: Another term for informal (illegal) evictions. These occur when landlords do not have a legal reason for evicting a tenant, do not know the proper procedure, or want to save on court costs. We have heard of landlords turning the heat off in the winter, neglecting to maintain apartments, or changing the apartment\\u2019s locks. A survey done by researcher Matthew Desmond in Milwaukee found that two thirds of landlord-initiated evictions happened without a legal paper trail. (<a href='https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-we-undercounted-evictions-by-asking-the-wrong-questions/' target='_blank'>MARS</a>). In the case of a self-help eviction, the tenant may sue the landlord for damages. They can receive compensation for damages such as the cost of temporary housing, the cost of food that spoiled after utilities were cut off, and any lost property.
