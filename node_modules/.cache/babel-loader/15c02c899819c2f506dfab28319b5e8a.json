Most of the information online about evictions and their legal proceedings is geared towards landlords, i.e. “how to evict a tenant.” There are virtually no materials on how to prevent an eviction, as a tenant or landlord. Evictions are governed by state and city laws, so there is no “catch-all” advice for tenants going through procedure in the United States.',\n            recommendationsOptions: [\n                {\n                    outline: 'Rhode Island needs to guarantee a right to counsel (aka a right to a lawyer) in eviction court.

Cross-referencing the street homeless database and the shelter database, DHS would report on the “last shelter” their HOME-STAT clients stayed at before leaving to live on the streets. This will help the City Council zero in on the problematic shelters that are causing people to choose to live on the streets. It will also add an additional metric and enhance shelter evaluation.
